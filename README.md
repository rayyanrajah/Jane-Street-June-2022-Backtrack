Project where I implemented backtracking with additional logic for efficiency to solve Jane Street's June 2022 puzzle.

NOTE: Despite the additional logic, the program still takes a while to compute the answer. A resolution for this, which I am currently working on, would be to model the problem as a linear program and use the Python PuLP library to solve it (similar Sudoku LP (link))
